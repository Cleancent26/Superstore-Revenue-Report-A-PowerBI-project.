### Problem Statement/Research Question.
This project tends to create insights such as; whats the revenue total revenue,whats the revenue generated by states,whats the revenue generated by cities,
whats the revenue trend across months.
Its also focuses on the product performance by shading more lights on the various on product with high demand,revenue and profit.


### Data Collection.
Data used for this project are sourced from secondary sources for evaluation and analysis.


### Data Cleaning
This data contains several errors such as date format inconsistencies,outliers, spelling errors, null values etc which were all attended to according and got the data
prepared for analysis.
Cleaning was done in ms excel.


### Data Analysis
I also carried out analysis to gain more insights about this data and to further identify trends to aid further transformation and growth of the business, such as using 
conditional formatting to showcase product with poor performance like color formatting to show product with low quantity ordered,low and high revenue, high and low profit
and revenue. In the course of my analysis, i was also able to discover that there are some products that generate high revenue but generated losses in profit.

### Data Visualyzation.
In the course of this, I also carried out visualisation of the data to portray my data analysis a in a more simple and edible form for easy undestanding of various indicators, like product
performance and revenue performance by states , cities,region and revenue trend cross various months of the year. In the visualization, I visualised top performing products,region,cities 
and also showcase the revenue trend across the months of the year.

### Recommendations.
This anlysis has been able to create insights on the performance of various products and through that, I derived the insight that certain products as can be seen on the
product performance report with conditinal formatting generated high revenue but also generated losses in profit. This high revenue can be due to either high cost goods
or goods with high quantity ordered. in solving this, the sale price of such goods should be reviewed upward and if this causes a large decline in the quantity ordered, such
that little sales are gotten, the certain percentage of the revenue of the goods could be used in purchasing othe products that generate high profit as could be seen in the
product performance report.
